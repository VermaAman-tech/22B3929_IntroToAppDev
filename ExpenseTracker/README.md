This is the Final Submission of LS:Intro to App Development where I have added 4 New features which are:
1. A option for the User to arrange the Transactions in Ascending and Descending Order.
2. A selection option for the user on the top right to select either the Expenses or Income from the Drop down available.
3. A slider Delete Option for the user to slide to the left to delete.
4. Along with the transactions the user can also add Notes to the Transactions.
